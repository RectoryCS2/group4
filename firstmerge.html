      Babysitting!
    </h1>
    <p>
     While my coworker mows the lawn, I will babysit any children between the ages of 3 and 12! Any younger than that you probably shouldn't leave them with a babysitter and any older they can be left alone. The hourly charge to just exist and make sure they live is <b>$16 hourly</b> for one child and an extra <b>$4 per extra child</b>.
